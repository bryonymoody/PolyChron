# Developer Reference

PolyChron is a graphical `python` application built using `tkinter`.

- `.github/` contains CI workflows and other GitHub specific files.
- `docs/` contains the source for this documentation, using `mkdocs`.
- `src` contains the python package source files.
- `tests/` contains a `pytest` test suite and associated input files.

> [!WARNING]
>
> `PolyChron` is intended to be used as a GUI application, rather than a traditional python library.
>
> The API reference documentation is mainly intended to support development.
>
> PolyChron is released following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and any usage of the API should be considered unstable until `v1.0`.

## Architecture

The application is structured following a Model-View-Persenter (MVP) architecture, where:

- Model classes are contained within the `models` submodule, and contain the underlying data and methods to manipulate the data.
- View classes contain the `tkinter` GUI code and are contained within the `views` submodule. They are implemented as *passive views* to simplify testing via mocking.
- Presenter clasess conect the underlying data (Model) with the GUI (View), and are located within the `presenters` submodule. Presenters typically have a corresponding View class, while the Model class is likely shared with other Presenters.

The `GUIApp` module is the main class which initialses the Models, Views and Presenters, and starts the render loop.
