# PolyChron
PolyChron is prototype software required to be installed locally on a userâ€™s machine, allowing users to produce multiple chronological models. In addition, it allows the user to obtain graph theoretic representations
of their stratigraphic sequences and prior knowledge within a given hierarchical Bayesian chronological model and save the raw digital data (as collected on-site) along with graph theoretic representations of their models, resulting outputs and supplementary notes produced during such modelling on their machine, thus facilitating future archiving of a complete site archive.
